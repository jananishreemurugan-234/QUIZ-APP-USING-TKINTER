# QUIZ-APP-USING-TKINTER

## Project Overview

This project is part of the RISE Internship Python Programming Projects. The goal of this project is to design a GUI-based Quiz Application using the Tkinter library in Python. Practicing multiple-choice questions in an interactive way makes preparation for competitive exams, interviews, or academic tests more engaging and effective.

The application provides a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), allows the user to select answers, navigate through the quiz, and displays the final score at the end. It is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the use of Tkinter GUI widgets, event handling, and simple logic building in Python.


## Features

Graphical User Interface built with Tkinter.

Displays one question at a time with four options.

Users can select answers using radio buttons.

Next button to move to the next question.

Displays final score in a popup window once the quiz ends.

Simple and clean design, easy to understand.

(Optional) Can be extended to load questions from a JSON file or database.


## Technologies Used

Python 3.13.6

Tkinter (Pythonâ€™s standard GUI library)


## How to Run
### 1.Run the program

python quiz_app.py

## Usage

A window will appear showing the first question.

Select an answer by clicking on the radio button.

Click Next to move to the next question.

At the end, a message box will show your final score.


## Future Enhancements

Add Previous button to review earlier answers.

Add a timer for each question to simulate real exam conditions.

Store results in a file or database.

Allow importing questions from a JSON/CSV file.

Improve UI with colors, images, or progress bar.


## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I learned:

How to build a GUI application with Tkinter.

How to use labels, radio buttons, buttons, and message boxes.

Managing application state (current question, score tracking).

Handling events and user input in a GUI environment.

Structuring a small project for readability and future enhancements.


## Conclusion
This Quiz App demonstrates how Python and Tkinter can be used to build an interactive and educational application. It can serve as a foundation for creating more advanced quiz or exam preparation platforms. With additional features, this project can easily be converted into a full educational product for students and learners.
